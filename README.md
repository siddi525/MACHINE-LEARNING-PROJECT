                      REGRESSION MODEL


INTRODUCTION:
This report outlines the results and key strategies employed in a machine learning project aimed at achieving high accuracy. The project utilized a dataset containing information from various trials, with each trial represented by different columns labelled as "r1t1" through "r2t4." The dataset comprises 13,953 rows, each corresponding to a specific experiment within the machine learning project.

DATASET OVERVIEW:
The dataset used for this machine learning project consists of four CSV files: ALL_X_train_p.csv, ALL_y_train_p.csv, ALL_X_test_p.csv, and ALL_y_test_p.csv. These files contain training and testing data for the machine learning model. Let's provide an overview of the structure and contents of these
datasets.


EXPLORING:
Exploring the dataset is a crucial step in understanding its characteristics, identifying patterns, and preparing for the machine learning model. Let's perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on the provided dataset.
Let's start by examining the summary statistics for the numerical columns in the training features (x_train), (y_train), (X_test) and (y_test) to get an overall sense of the data distribution.



MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
The splitting of the dataset into training and validation sets using the train_test_split function.
The train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection is used to partition the original dataset into training and validation sets. The training set (x_trainandy_train_scaled)willbeusedtotrainthedataset,whilethevalidation set (x_val and y_val) will be used to assess the model's performance during training. The test_size=0.2 parameter specifies that 20% of the data will be
  
allocated to the validation set, and random_state=42 ensures reproducibility by fixing the random seed.



TRAINING:
The training the previously defined model using the training set (x_train and y_train_scaled). Additionally, the validation set (x_val and y_val) is used to evaluate the model's performance during training.



VISUALIZING:
The training and validation loss, as well as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) over the course of training epochs. This visualization is a useful way to assess the model's performance and identify potential overfitting or underfitting. A reduction in both loss and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) over the course of training epochs is generally a positive sign.


EVALUATING:

Making Predictions:
The model.predict(x_test) line generates predictions using the trained neural network model on the test features (x_test).
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Calculation:
The mean_absolute_error function is then used to calculate the mean absolute error between the predicted values (predictions) and the actual scaled target values for the test set (y_test_scaled).
Accuracy-like Metric Calculation:
The accuracy-like metric is calculated using the formula: Accuracy-like Metric.




CONCLUSION:
Training Accuracy: [0.98]
Test Accuracy: [1.99]
Other Metrics: [mean absolute error: 0.6 and R-squared score: 88.00]
In conclusion, this machine learning endeavor demonstrated success in achieving a high level of accuracy. However, ongoing refinement and optimization are essential to ensure the model's reliability in real-world
   
scenarios. The insights gained from this project lay the groundwork for future enhancements and the application of machine learning techniques to similar problem domains.
